Real-Time Elephant Detection & Conflict Prevention System

Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to track elephants and prevent human-wildlife conflicts. The system detects elephants in real-time and triggers alerts to mitigate potential dangers.

Features

Real-Time Detection: Utilizes YOLO for fast and accurate elephant detection.

Training & Deployment: Developed using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.

Dataset Pre-processing: Pandas & SQL used for handling large datasets and improving model accuracy.

Automated Alerts: Sends real-time notifications via email and activates alarms for immediate action.

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow

YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Pandas

SQL

SMTP (for email notifications)

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elephant-tracking.git
cd elephant-tracking

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download and set up YOLO weights:

wget https://example.com/yolo-weights-file

Run the detection script:

python detect.py

Dataset Pre-processing

Used Pandas and SQL for cleaning and structuring data.

Augmented dataset to improve model accuracy.

How It Works

The system captures real-time video feed from a camera.

YOLO detects elephants in the frame.

If an elephant is detected:

Email notifications are triggered.

An alarm is activated to alert nearby individuals.

Future Enhancements

Integrating IoT-based alert systems.

Expanding model training to recognize other wildlife species.

Deploying on edge devices for lower latency.
